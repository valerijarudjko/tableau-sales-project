# Tableau Sales Dashboard Project

This project demonstrates how to build an interactive sales dashboard using Tableau, powered by two primary datasets:

1. **Hexmap Data** (`hexmap.xlsx`): Contains spatial geometry information (hexagonal mapping) for visualising regions.
2. **Sales Data** (`Sales Data.xls`): Contains historical sales records, including product, region, time period, and revenue figures.
